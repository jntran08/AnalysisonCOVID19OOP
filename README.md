Data Structure Projects

Project 1: Covid 19 Dataset in OOP  
The goal of this project is to: 

(1)	Learn to create class structure in C++
(2)	Create an array of objects in C++
(3)	Search and perform operations on the array of objects

Project Description:
The input csv file for this project consists of rows of data that deals with COVID-19 cases and deaths per day for each county in every state in the United States. 

The command input file include
counts	       //number of data entries in the csv file
Filename.csv  //this is the file that contains the covid-19 data
Command     //details of what constitutes a command is given below

Once the file is opened, the data from each row of the csv file is read and a COVID19 object is generated. The COVID19 class is given and necessary methods need to be implemented

Projecr 2: LinkedSortedArray and SortedArray OOP

The objective of this project is to read the entry data of random numbers and input it into the LinkedSortedArray class which contain SortedArray in its memory. 

If the elements are stored in sorted order in an array, a binary search is performed
to locate the element much faster. This involves 'insert', 'remove', 'find'

For LinkedSortedArray data structures, an array of size K, call this array A.

Insert elements into array A and make sure the elements are kept in sorted order. As soon as the
array A of size K is filled up and we want to insert the (K+1)th element. Rather than creating a larger array, we would create another array B (of size K); move half the elements in A into the array B such that the largest number in A is less than the smallest number in B. The array A is now linked to array B as in a LinkedList.
