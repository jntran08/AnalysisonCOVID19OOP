Data Structure Projects

Project 1: Covid 19 Classes 
The goal of this project is to: 

(1)	Learn to create class structure in C++
(2)	Create an array of objects in C++
(3)	Search and perform operations on the array of objects

Project Description:
The input csv file for this project consists of rows of data that deals with COVID-19 cases and deaths per day for each county in every state in the United States. 

The command input file include
counts	       //number of data entries in the csv file
Filename.csv  //this is the file that contains the covid-19 data
Command     //details of what constitutes a command is given below

Once the file is opened, the data from each row of the csv file is read and a COVID19 object is generated. The COVID19 class is given and necessary methods need to be implemented
